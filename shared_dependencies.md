Shared Dependencies:

1. Android SDK: All the java files and XML layout files will share the Android SDK as a dependency for building the Android app.

2. AppCompatActivity: The MainActivity.java, ChatMode.java, and DeveloperMode.java will extend AppCompatActivity, which is a part of the Android SDK.

3. AIEngine: The AIEngine.java will be used by both ChatMode.java and DeveloperMode.java for processing user input and generating responses.

4. Personality and Memory: The Personality.java and Memory.java will be used by AIEngine.java to develop and reference the AI's personality and memory.

5. ProjectSetup and CodeGenerator: The DeveloperMode.java will use ProjectSetup.java and CodeGenerator.java to create and setup projects and generate code.

6. LearningModule and EvolutionModule: The AIEngine.java will use LearningModule.java and EvolutionModule.java to learn, evolve, and improve itself with each interaction.

7. SelfPrompter and TodoList: The AIEngine.java will use SelfPrompter.java and TodoList.java to self-prompt and manage tasks.

8. APKGenerator: The DeveloperMode.java will use APKGenerator.java to generate a downloadable APK.

9. activity_main, chat_mode, developer_mode: These XML layout files will be used by MainActivity.java, ChatMode.java, and DeveloperMode.java respectively for their user interfaces.

10. colors.xml and styles.xml: These will be used across all XML layout files for defining the color scheme and styles for the app's user interface.

11. AndroidManifest.xml: This will be used by the Android system to understand the appâ€™s components and permissions.

12. build.gradle and settings.gradle: These will be used by the Android build system to build and configure the app.

13. R.java: This auto-generated file will be used across all java files and XML layout files for accessing resources, including id names of every DOM elements.

14. Message Names: "chat_mode", "developer_mode", "project_setup", "code_generation", "learning", "evolution", "self_prompt", "todo_list", "apk_generation". These will be used for communication between different components of the app.

15. Function Names: "onCreate", "onStart", "onResume", "onPause", "onStop", "onDestroy". These lifecycle methods will be used in MainActivity.java, ChatMode.java, and DeveloperMode.java.
